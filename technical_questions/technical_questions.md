# Scala

## Data Structure and Algorithm
* What is the size of an int? 4 bytes (32 bits)
* How many numbers can be in an int? 9 or 10 digits
* What is the complexity of finding the numbers in a list? O(n)
* What about a sorted list? Does the complexity changed? O(log n), Elements are found via binary search in a sorted list.
* What is the complexity of getting a value from a hashmap? O(1)
* How does a hash map work? Hash map (also dict in python) stores key-value pairs. It determines the location of the value by its key.

## Concept
* What is big data? 
* What is Spark?

## Experience
* Tell me about the projects you have worked on and focus on the engineering part
